# Java Voting Machine Simulator

Welcome to the Java Voting Machine Simulator, a robust and user-friendly application designed to simulate the entire voting process, from voter registration to result analysis. This project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing elections at various levels, including presidential, gubernatorial, and mayoral elections.

Features
Voter Registration:

Register voters with a unique identification to ensure a secure and traceable voting process.
Validate voter information during registration to prevent duplicate entries.
Candidate Registration:

Register candidates for three distinct positions: President, Governor, and Mayor.
Capture and store detailed information about each candidate, including their party affiliation and key details.
Voting Process Simulation:

Simulate the voting process with a seamless and intuitive interface.
Ensure that voters can cast their votes only once and only for eligible candidates.
Fraud Detection:

Implement robust mechanisms to track and detect fraudulent activities during the voting process.
Enhance election integrity by identifying and preventing potential frauds.
Results and Analysis:

Count the votes and display comprehensive results for each position.
Determine the overall winner and highlight the political party that elected the most candidates.

# Development Details
Language and Paradigm:

The Java Voting Machine Simulator is developed entirely in Java, utilizing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.
Class Integration:

The project employs a modular structure with distinct classes for voters, candidates, and the voting process. The integration between these classes is facilitated through well-defined interfaces, fostering code reusability and scalability.
Menu Functionality:

To enhance user interaction, a dedicated class for menu functionalities has been implemented. This class provides a clear and user-friendly interface, guiding users through voter registration, candidate registration, and the voting process.
Data Storage and Retrieval:

Candidate and voter information is stored efficiently using arrays of objects. This approach not only ensures a structured and organized data storage but also enables seamless search operations with linear complexity (O(n)). The runtime remains independent of the number of candidates or electors, contributing to the scalability of the application.
OOP Principles:

The application adheres to the core principles of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This design choice promotes code clarity, maintainability, and extensibility.
Complexity Considerations:

Emphasis has been placed on optimizing the complexity of critical operations. For instance, the linear search for candidates or electors ensures that the runtime remains proportional to the size of the dataset, ensuring efficient performance even with a large number of candidates or voters.
Code Quality and Documentation:

The project follows best practices for code quality, and extensive documentation is provided to aid developers in understanding and contributing to the codebase.
